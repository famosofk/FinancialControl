# FinancialControl

This is a working in progress kotlin app. 
It might be able to help farmers to control the cash flow of their business.
Actualy, I've studied a lot since I've started this app and It's a mess, but I planned to implement the basic feature and then I'll fix it
adding some architecture patterns and refactoring it.
